      <p style="color: darkgray; ">Peaky Blinders is a British period crime drama
        television series created by Steven Knight.
        Set in Birmingham, England, the series follows the exploits of the <span
          style="color: rgb(248, 20, 20);">Shelby</span> crime family in the direct aftermath of the First World War.

        The fictional family is loosely based on a real 19th-century urban youth gang of the same name, who were
        active
        in the city from the <span style="color: floralwhite;">1890s</span>
        to the early twentieth century.

        the BAFTA TV Awards, Knight confirmed his <br>
        <span style="color: rgb(233, 45, 12); font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">"ambition of
          making
          it a story of a family between two wars, and by ending it with the first air raid siren in
          Birmingham"</span>
        , <br>
        which was 25 June 1940. After the conclusion of the fourth series, he confirmed that it would take another
        three
        series (seven in total) <br>
        to complete the story up to that point.The fifth series premiered on BBC One on 25 August 2019 and finished on
        22 September 2019. <br>
        <span style="color: red;">Netflix</span>, under the deal with Weinstein Company and Endemol, had acquired the

          <p> Peaky Blinders was created by <mark>Steven Knight</mark>, directed
            by Otto Bathurst, and produced by <mark>Katie Swinden</mark>. The writers are listed as <span
              style="color: red;">Steven Knight,
              Stephen Russell and Toby Finlay</span>.Screen Yorkshire provided funding for the production through the
            Yorkshire Content Fund,
            ensuring that the majority of the show was filmed in Yorkshire as part of the deal.The series was filmed in
            Birmingham,
            Bradford, Dudley, Leeds, Liverpool, and Port Sunlight. Railway sequences were filmed between Keighley and
            Damems,

            using carriages from the Ingrow Museum of Rail Travel (owned by Vintage Carriages Trust),
            and carriages owned by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Trust. Many of the scenes for the show were shot
            at
            the Black Country Living Museum.
            Ulster-born, New Zealand-raised Sam Neill enlisted the help of Northern Irish actors James Nesbitt and Liam
            Neeson
            to help him recover his lost
            Northern Irish accent for the role of C.I. Campbell. In the end, he had to tone down the accent since the
            series
            is being marketed in the United States.
            Controversially, the production did not hire linguists to assist in the show, leading to the Gypsies'
            frequently
            speaking broken Romanian (as opposed to Romani)

          <p> During the initial broadcast of series 3, the BBC renewed Peaky
            Blinders for series 4 and 5, each of which comprises six episodes.
            Filming for series 4 started in March 2017 and premiered on 15 November 2017 on BBC Two. The fourth series
            did
            not
            include The Weinstein Company or its logo in its credits and will continue to no longer be included,
            even though the company was formerly involved in the US distribution of the series.

            On 22 August 2018, the BBC confirmed that series 5 would be broadcast on BBC One.
            Having already premiered to a select audience at Birmingham Town Hall on 18 July 2019, the series began
            airing
            on
            BBC One on 25 August 2019. </p>

      <p>The Peaky Blinders were an urban street gang based in Birmingham, England, that operated from the end of the
        19th
        century
        to after the First World War. The group, which grew out of the harsh economic deprivations of working class
        Britain,
        was composed largely of young men of lower to middle-classes. They derived social power from robbery, violence,
        racketeering,
        illegal bookmaking and the control of gambling. Members of this gang wore a signature outfit that included
        tailored jackets,
        lapel overcoats, button waistcoats, silk scarves, bell-bottom trousers, leather boots, and peaked flat caps.

        The gang was highly organized with its own systems of hierarchy.



        The Blinders’ dominance came about from beating rivals, such as the "Sloggers", whom they fought for
        territory in
        Birmingham and its surrounding districts. They held control for nearly 20 years until 1910, when a larger gang,

        the Birmingham Boys led by Billy Kimber, overtook them. However, even though they had disappeared by the 1920s,

        the name of the "Peaky Blinders" became synonymous slang for any street gang in Birmingham.
      </p>

      <h3>Notorious Members</h3>
      <p>Contrary to popular belief, most Peaky Blinders were from the middle class and had jobs. The most powerful
        member
        of the Peaky Blinders
        was a man known as Kevin Mooney. His real name was Thomas Gilbert, but he routinely changed his last name.
        He initiated many of the land grabs undertaken by the gang.

        Other prominent members of the gang were David Taylor, <span style="color: red;">Earnest Haynes, Harry Fowles,
          and
          Stephen McNickle</span> .
        Harry Fowles, known as "Baby-faced Harry", was arrested at age 19 for stealing a bike in October 1904.
        McNickle and Haynes were also arrested at the same time, for stealing a bicycle and home invasion, respectively.

        Each was held for one month for their crimes. West Midlands police records described the three arrested
        as "foul mouthed young men who stalk the streets in drunken groups, insulting and mugging passers-by.
        Taylor was arrested at age 13 for carrying a loaded firearm.[13]

        Many gang members were veterans of the <span style="color: red;">First World War</span> . Henry Lightfoot, the
        first person to be named as a Peaky Blinder,
        had joined the British Army three times in his life and participated in the Battle of the Somme in 1916.
        One of the youngest members, Henry Fowler, was buried alive in the trenches and could not speak or see for some
        time following the war.

        The notorious gangster <span style="color: red;">Billy Kimber</span> was also a former Peaky Blinder.
